# Java Collections & Threads

This project includes Java programs demonstrating the use of collections framework and multithreading concepts.

## Collection Framework

### Task 1: ArrayList
- **File:** `CollectionFrameworkTask1.java`
- Creates an ArrayList of integers and prints the group of integers.

### Task 3: HashSet
- **File:** `CollectionFrameworkTask3.java`
- Uses a HashSet to store a group of integers, demonstrating unique element storage.

### Task 4: ArrayDeque
- **File:** `CollectionFrameworkTask4.java`
- Implements a Queue using ArrayDeque and performs operations like insertion and removal of elements.

### Task 5: PriorityQueue
- **File:** `CollectionFrameworkTask5.java`
- Utilizes a PriorityQueue to insert and remove elements, showcasing the priority-based ordering.

## Multithreading

### Runnable Task
- **File:** `RunnableTask.java`
- Implements a simple thread using the Runnable interface.

### Thread Greetings
- **Files:** `HumanGreeting.java`, `ThreadPoolTask1.java`, `CountryGreeting.java`, `ThreadPoolTask2.java`, `ThreadTask.java`
- Demonstrates basic thread creation and execution with greetings.

### ThreadPool
- **Files:** `ThreadPoolTask3.java`, `WorkerThread.java`
- Illustrates the use of a thread pool using ExecutorService and creating worker threads for concurrent processing.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishna-kusum/Java_Collections_Threads.git
   cd Java_Collections_Threads
   ```

2. Compile and run the Java files using a Java compiler and the Java command.
